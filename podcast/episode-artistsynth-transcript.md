Tom Ray: Hi, and welcome to another Lorenzo's Music Podcast. I'm Tom Ray, and this is a show where I talk with musicians, people that create things for musicians. and a lot of the time I focus because it's what I'm interested in, in people in the Creative Commons and open source realm. And today I am talking with someone who is in both of those. And we'll explain that in a bit. But first I'm just gonna have him introduce himself and, say hi and what he does.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Hi, I'm Jonatan Galindo Alvarez. Most, of the time I go to the ArtistSynth and, I mostly do my music on not in everything open source, but mostly my. My operating system is Ubuntu

Tom Ray: Oh, you do? Okay, sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. Continue.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I use Lubuntu because I use Ubuntu. I used Ubuntu Studio once in my main PC and KDE with Nvidia driver. Well.

Tom Ray: Oh, really? It didn't work.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Not so great for me.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: But, I use Ubuntu I prefer. I prefer it. And it. It was like a, bump experience because, well, Nvidia drivers.

Tom Ray: And what version were you using? Okay, we're getting. We're getting into it already. But first, of all, let me, Let me explain. Okay? You are, you're. Where are you located again?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I'm from Canary Island

Tom Ray: Okay. And you're located there right now or are you living.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, I'm living in Canary Islands.

Tom Ray: Okay. And you go by, so you go by Artist Synth, but you also go by Artist with the. Each letter has dot after it. So explain that. First of all, your name.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I found it funny. Like, get a generic type of, name because of. Because of. Maybe. Maybe it was like, those Witch House producers and something like that. Maybe was Salem or something like that. Or Crosses. I think it was inspired by Salem, for example. But I wanted like the most generic name.

Tom Ray: Right.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: So I did the A dot.

Tom Ray: okay, I do like that you added Artist synth because it makes it much easier to search for you when I was doing research.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah. And, because of. Of search, searching and see SEO and such, I. I change it to Artisynth and, artist with the dots and such as a logo.

Tom Ray: Yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: So it will be easier.

Tom Ray: Well, and if you were to put like, you can't necessarily use A dot, R dot, whatever as a URL, because there would be. I mean, can you put periods in URLs other than the I Don't think so.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I don't think so. Like that.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: It will be like a mess.

Tom Ray: Yeah. Okay, now back to what we were talking about. I just wanted to clear up that stuff before we get started. So we. When you were using the Ubuntu Studio, when you were trying, that with Nvidia, which I don't. I think I've used an Nvidia card once and that was like many years ago. But, which version of Ubuntu Studio were you running? Because, when they first introduced KDE into it, it did still kind of have some issues and it seemed to like to crash on certain systems.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I use it, I think the latest lts because I wanted like a stable. So. So yeah, it's mostly a problem that my, My card is not, not too new, not too old. And it's an Nvidia card that Nvidia has problems with some stuff in Linux. Because.

Tom Ray: Yes, yes. Is not, Is not silent about how much Nvidia vexes him, makes him angry ye.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: The. The FMV thing. So.

Tom Ray: And okay, I was just checking that because when they, Because we're running. My band is running the LTS version of Ubuntu Studio 2 and it's much better than the previous LTS version they had. Whereas if something crashed, you went through this and. And I. Actually there's, there's Well, by the time this comes out, it will have already been released. But I'm, doing an interview with the, With Eric who runs the Ubuntu Studio project and I talked to him about this. Like when they first introduced it, it went into like this crash loop. Like even it would give you the alert and you'd close the alert or go, yes, send it. And then it would go, but we have this alert and it would just continue. You had to literally reboot to get it to stop sending you like, hey, it showed an error and it's like. Did you not see this? It was almost like it was nagging you. So. But anyway, I was curious if that was the one you were using. All right, anyway, moving on from there. Yes. So you use open source, just like, us. That's awesome. I did not know that part of it. Now what I did know is that you release under Creative Commons and first of all, how would you explain your music to people? How would you describe it?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: That's not the easy part because. Well, it's in. I think it's in the realm of synth wave, of mini what? Minimal synthesis. Of short. But Then I have like a few songs that are. How to say it? Okay. That are. Most. Are most. so. And I have a few songs that are for video games. And Ah, video game people in a game, Jan, they ask you like, oh, can you do like a regular reggaeton type beat? You can do this or that or it's more like a varied thing. So it's. It's just like clashing.

Tom Ray: So you're saying that is the stuff you do for video games is different than what you do for yourself just as a musician. So they're kind of different. Yeah. And. And that makes sense. And we're. I'm going to ask you more about that video game stuff in a bit. But yeah, the So the style. I mean, I like it in the sense where some of it even seems kind of like. Oh, what would be the best way to put it? they seem like random thought inspiration, especially with the shorter songs. Like you'll be like, I have this idea. And then you do it. You orchestrate it. You layer different things on it. And then you're like, all right, that was the idea, you know, and it's like a 30 second song.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: But it's funny. Funny enough I did like a, one second song or something like that for, for. For a project really? That was like m. It was called El Punto in Spanish.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: It is on Itch IO we can talk about it.

Tom Ray: Yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: When we talk about video games.

Tom Ray: Yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: But it was like a project that. Okay, you, you have like a second or two seconds mostly and you have to you have to do a, a song or a recording, whatever.

Tom Ray: Yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: You have to, you have to be into. To select a color. So I was like, okay, let me use that M. One second to, to do a thing and have a color that is. Is referencing my, my logo and such.

Tom Ray: So, so the, the one second we'll call it a song. But I want to say it's. So you're saying it was to select a color.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yes, because the game is. You have a dot. Uh-huh. And when you click it, it changes the color and makes a sound. So.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: A ah, sound that is like one second, three seconds. I don't remember how much, but it was like short.

Tom Ray: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. And there, there is a lot of that. Okay, so let's get into the. The itch IO stuff. Let's get into the games because clearly, like, this is all part of it. And I didn't know that. I didn't know if they. Well, I mean, it seems like you do it a lot. You do have a lot of games listed as ones that you've worked on, on, the page that you link to for that. So I've tried a few of these games. I did some of them. I did horribly at them. But that's also because the games themselves are written in a different language. I'm not able to translate those. So I kind of had to guess what I was doing regardless. I just wanted to see what they did. Yeah. So now are you. So you're not making any of these games, you're making music for the games?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, I make the music and the sounds. So most of the time is the music and the sound. Sometimes in. I think a few of them is just a sound. Like in Astronomica.

Tom Ray: Uh-huh.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I only made the sounds and one partner does all, ah, the music.

Tom Ray: So you do have a writing partner that you work with on these or they had somebody else.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Not always, because it depends. But sometimes I have like, ah, a background in. How to say it? Soundtage, I think.

Tom Ray: Okay. Sound tech.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, it will be fitting rather than a, compose or something like that. So. Okay for me will be easy. The easy part is making sounds and making feet and just making fit that, in the, in the hole you have, How to explain it? Okay. If, if anyone sent me maybe a soundtrack of something like that, I will design those sounds that will fit that BSO and make it indistinguishable for the ambience and the music. But not like a sore thumb.

Tom Ray: Right, Right. So they're saying we're doing a game and we would like music for it that's similar to this particular soundtrack. And then you would go, okay, and you would, you would do something in that style without. Without directly ripping it off is what you're saying. Yeah, without stealing it. so how are, how did you get involved with people who make these games? How did they find you? How are you, how come you're. You're getting these opportunities?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I mostly go to game jams. I. The first one I, I did in. In a Place, it was like in2019 or something like that. But there are online ones also in each IO that ah, you can like, hey, I'm a music producer or a sound design guy. If you need sounds or maybe music, you can ask me. And then so on, so on, so on.

Tom Ray: Okay, so you actually were, you, you yourself were putting your name out there going, I can do this work for you if you want it. Were you actually posting on it or was it mostly in these game jams that you went to?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Mostly in the game jams because. Because it is easier for me to have like, doing game jams and. And keep. Keep doing those because. Well, there's no much space in where I live to newer. Newer bands or something like that. And it's becoming like worse in a sense because. Why? Well, everything is like, M. Not to say. Not to say something bad for. For the tribute bands, but people. People like tribute bands because they remember the perjam. item M. Right. That stuff. And

Tom Ray: No, that tribute bands are. Yeah, that's. You want to make some money? Be in a tribute band? You want. You want to. If you want to make money as an actual artist. Well, good luck. yeah, that kind of stuff. So do you actually, when you do these games? Because. So I only know about Itch IO, because somebody actually used one of our songs in a game. Ours is released under Creative Commons and they just used one of our songs. And I got an alert about it or maybe they told me, I don't know. Somehow I found out and I was like, this is fantastic. Ours was just kind of background music. It was. It's more of a RPG where people walk through and it's more like they look for things they're not like fighting or doing well. I guess it's a quest if it's an rpg. But they were just. It's. You walk through and try to solve this mystery, I guess. And in this one house, our song is playing like someone left the radio on. And it's kind of a spooky little slower sort of song that we have and was super cool. I was like, oh, the game's in black and white and it's an eight bit and all that kind of stuff. And I was like, this is really neat. Then I looked around and found out what Itch IO was. Now our game was just used and we're cool with that because that's how we do it. Are you actually being employed to do these or you're just doing it because you really love doing it for games? Like, is it actually something that you do as a professional musician?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Not really. Because. So. So, if I have to say, like. Like what. What is my job? I. I did a lot of jobs. So maybe Charm Bear made, selling furniture and such, but not much. Not musician. I did like, some sound effects for. For a game and they pay me m. Not, not legally.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Quote unquote. But it was like one of one thing that I did. But I'm not professionally on. On that.

Tom Ray: Yeah, we got a. So we had been releasing our music through Jamendo for a long time and Jamendo has a licensing section of their site where you can license your music. One of them is just for. They use it for public radios because of gamma laws and all that. So they're able to, they just pay the company to play this non copyrighted, non pro music. The other thing is too is people can license it for shorts for you know, things for a certain period of time. And we kind of, in the same way kind of got paid in the sense that a mobile game developer called Nexus Neck Ned, I don't even know how to pronounce it but it's a mobile game developer and he kind of makes games similar to like he's got a Grand Theft Auto one, he's got another one, some stick figure games and he uses our. He bought a license for it and he used it for one of his games and he's been continuing to use it for all its games which I'm sure that's not how it goes, but I don't care. But you know, we got a small fee and people keep telling. The cool thing about it is people keep going to our video for this song and like going, I heard this in Nexics or however you pronounce it. Like I don't even know how to pronounce the name. That's how much I know about it. But so yeah, we're in a similar one where it's like they kind of used it but they're continuing to use it. But whatever, you know, that's fine. Yeah, so no, I'm with you on that. Like we have to do other things to still kind of get by as musicians. We become a jack of all trades in that one. Now the, so making these songs, one of the reasons I'm talking to you too is because we did a call out for the Ubuntu Summit and by the time this comes out, the Ubuntu Summit will actually be the day this podcast will be scheduled. It will be the second day of the Ubuntu Summit. And one of the things I wanted to do is I did a call up for musicians to do a live stream and we were going to play that live stream in the after party after the summit and you were one of the people that submitted. I was watching Your stream. And this is what intrigued me. You are doing a live performance, but you're doing it in the daw. And that is something I have wanted to learn how to do. I use a different DAW than you. I, I'm not sure which daw. Which one do you use?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: First of all, I, I use Bitwig. It's not, it's not open, but. Well, one of the things that intrigued me to beat with his the workflow is Arleton based, you know, glyphs and such.

Tom Ray: Yeah. I was curious if it was Ableton.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: But I was like, yeah, coming from Ableton, I was using like I think in 2019 or something like that. And then when I became accustomed to maybe it's time to move to Linux, first I did the move from Arleton to Bitwig. Then I did the move from Windows 10 to Lubuntu in my laptop. Try it. Okay, Works. And nuke my Windows 10 to Ubuntu Studio. Didn't feel so well. And then Ubuntu

Tom Ray: Okay. All right. And you were running bitwig in that. So you're saying it is a similar setup to Ableton? I guess so. I know of bitwig, I know of the guy that works on it and he produces videos about all the stuff that he does for it. And I follow him. I'm spacing on his name right now. But I've been curious about it now while I was watching you do this and you were doing this live thing. So there's. I'm going to ask you a few questions and this is all from memory because, I'm not looking at it right now, but. So you were doing different scenes, switching things up. But that's the one thing I saw. You had scenes, you had little boxes that you would switch from and do things. Now first of all, explain these scenes to me. How do you set those up? What are they? It was kind of the thing that was running the background music you were using. Correct.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I tend to use the scenes to make sure that, okay, this is part one, part two, part three. and then run it in a live set. I use the scenes to mostly drums so I can, with something like this, like, okay, okay, okay, start then this, then that. And okay, just, just play the clips and then, and then I use my, my keyboard that is.

Tom Ray: Oh, you were using keyboard.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: This little guy. Oh, to make the, the music.

Tom Ray: Mm,

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: And I have, I have it like set up in a way that is like, okay, I have bass, Generating then, two parts, one left, one right to make it stereo different and a melody that is changing a little bit. And Bitweight makes like easier for me to make. Make it like, okay, I push one. One thing on my keyboard and makes the base the, the chords and such.

Tom Ray: Okay, set this up ahead of time. Or are you doing it as you're doing the live stream?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I set up ahead of time. Like, okay, I, I, okay, I have to check which key and such and then keep it flowing.

Tom Ray: Okay. All right, that makes more sense. That's, that's the one thing is it's like, I would like to be able to use like I m. Use Ardor and I would like to be able to do something like that in order doing the scenes sort of thing. I mean I could create loops, but Ardor being a linear or I guess it's. I can't remember where, where it just kind of goes across the tracks. I could loop it, but sometimes when you switch to different loops, like I could set markers and switch the markers and have it loop. I feel like it's going to give me an error. It'll do a thing where it's like, oh, it jumped too much and then it'll throw an X run error and it'll. Or it'll stop or freeze or something. I don't know. It's. I'm just saying I'm trying to figure out how to do it on there. Watching yours and seeing you do the scenes, I'm like, oh, it's kind of like, I don't know if you've ever used hydrogen. The drum mach machine that is in.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I know it, but never use it because I prefer, I prefer to have everything in my dough. Huh?

Tom Ray: Uh-huh. Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: But it's visible. You can go like, okay, Hydrogen plays the drums. Then everything goes to order or something like that. You can do crazy stuff like. Yeah, maybe you can do like just like Cardinal. that is, ah. A modular bst.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: To make music and keep it. Everything there and then send it to maybe a PA System or recording on.

Tom Ray: Right.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I don't know, Ardor or even Audacity.

Tom Ray: Well, my main thing is like yeah. Having that backup track and what, what Hydrogen has. As far as like you were saying, you were doing the scenes mainly for the beats. Hydrogen has the same sort of thing where you can have it loop and it has squares that you pick and each one of those squares can be a different beat that you can switch to. Or you can have it do it for a set period of time and loop back. So that's what I mean is it has something where I want it just to be like, okay, now I want it to switch to this beat. Whereas I don't have that ability or I, I'm not aware of how to do that in Ardor just by itself. anyway, I'm. Now I'm just thinking about it and it.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I think it would be easier for you if, if you use like Hydrogen and connect it to Ardor or use it like. I don't know if Hydrogen has a VST forma or a plugin format and use it.

Tom Ray: No, it would have to be connected through the patch bay. it's not like Yoshimi, where it actually is built in and you can add it as an instrument or it's a plugin built in. It would be an external that I would have to bring into Ardor. Hydrogen's the only thing I use that has to do that. So anyway, there's, you know, I'm still trying to figure it out, but I loved yours. And that was the other question I was going to ask too is when you were doing this. Because the way it was set up, the video is set up showing you working in the. The daw. The daw. And there was a picture of you on screen while you were doing it. But I wasn't sure if like how the synth and everything was in there. So you're saying you actually were playing the synth while you were. While you had these background beats, the scenes that you were switching from?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah. In the first one it was like everything in Bitwig. But in the second one I have to show this.

Tom Ray: Okay. Yeah, go ahead.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Okay. This bad boy. Ah, this bad boy is a Behringer K2.

Tom Ray: Okay, I like that.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Okay. A, reproduction, of Ms. 20. I bought it in, in Germany when, when I was there with my brother and such. And it was cheap. Like it's. It's not like cheap as 20 or 100. €100, but it was like 300ish euros. Wow. So it was cheap for a monophony synth. And it works. It's not the best one. I think if anyone wants to maybe a synth like this you can get like for the same price, mini Brood or it depends. But I really wanted like ah, an early synth and MS.20 are like famous for that. And this is like the cheap alternative to that. So yeah, I want to do that.

Tom Ray: No there's not one musician I know, unless they're super rich who doesn't have a this is the something version of, you know, this is the remake or this is the knockoff or this is the version before the one that I actually wanted. There's so many people that have the. This is the version that's the closest I could get price wise to yeah, you're, you're speaking the language of every musician right now. As far as, as far as talking about it's. I want the better one, but this one works great.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: So.

Tom Ray: Yeah, exactly. No, that's always, that's always the factor. And cheap, cheap musician, instrument wise, they're still, it's still amazing the cost of, or how much equipment costs for musicians and going like, oh, but this one's only a few hundred dollars as opposed to a thousand. You know, it's, it's still hundreds.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: For example, my, how to say it? my portable studio M more or less because it's not like portable. Portable is audio interface that is like M20ish euros or something like that. And audio m solo. My ThinkPad, it's 230-230. That is like cheap, cheap with eight gigs of RAM. And I think it was like the. An i5 from. I don't know, but it was like 100ish, 200ish laptop and then some chip headphones and There you go.

Tom Ray: So that's another question I was going to ask you. You just talked about your portable setup. So you do actually perform live and you do it as a solo artist?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: not really. I mostly do game. I don't perform live. I perform once.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: As a life musician and it was like me, not for me.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: So maybe it was like the, maybe it wasn't the right time for me. So.

Tom Ray: All right, well then if, then what do you do with your, your portable studio? My understanding of that when you said portable studio, it meant you take it somewhere to do things. So I was just assuming that you were playing live shows. So is this just your portable studio, is just your setup that you use at home or do you take it other places?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I, I take it to like maybe if, if a game John has a place to stay. I take, I take not everything on my, on my bedroom and I have my portable stuff. So it will be like, okay, I have my laptop and so and so and then okay, go M. And it will be very easy for me than having everything.

Tom Ray: I just show up with a big truck yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: And I, I did once like having my. My guitar and my. My synthesizer and Have to grab everything on back or something like that. I don't have the chat word in.

Tom Ray: English but in Amaletta you're talking about the.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Not a backpack.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Those running backpacks to go to airports and such. And it was like okay, no, I don't have to do this. This is so much. And I even have a gig bag for my guitar, so.

Tom Ray: Oh, okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, not really. It was like a little bit of a stretch to do that for game jams.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Because well m. They can ask you like okay, I need maybe a ah. Song that has like strings or something like that. So it's just too much. It was too much for. For that.

Tom Ray: Yeah.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: And.

Tom Ray: And also it's one of those things where like yeah, maybe you have a song that needs strings or you know, guitar on it. But also, I mean do you really want to bring it just in case you need it? Like it's a lot to carry. Just in case you get by. I don't know, but I get it. I. I understand. and now So with the music that you've been putting out and you released something I believe it was this year where it was actually a collection I think. What. What was it called? It was like 2014 to 2025. Yeah. Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Collection of songs that did that I did for various games. So.

Tom Ray: Yeah. And that one for sure was one where it's like here's a 30 second song, here's a 15 second song and then here's a minute and 30. Like they were. It was a definite collection of different types of songs.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah. Is most devs or game devs, they. They will ask like a short song like maybe m. Maybe a minute or even less. Because well it's. It's not like you have to hear it like m in a games like Grand Theft Auto or some. Or something much longer. So it will be like okay, short songs for short games and keep it interesting in those short periods of time. So it will be like okay, I need this and this and make it not so repetitive and make a transition. Something like that and loop very well. Yeah. So I have to that to do that kind of workflow.

Tom Ray: And it's. No. I liked listening to it. It was really. When I first listened to it, I didn't know that that's what I was going to be hearing. So it was interesting in the sense as it went through the songs, I was like, wait, did. Is this a new song? And I kind of liked it. After a while, it was just like, oh, okay, cool. It's like just. It's like, just, you know, attention span theater or attention span music. Like, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, no, I've. Now we've moved on to another idea, and I enjoyed that. do you have any plans for other releases that you're putting out? Do you have any albums or anything like that coming up?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: right now? Not really, because I'm mostly in, like, how to say it? In a stale state. Like, maybe I have to, think about what I will do next. But most I will do for sure. Making music for games. Yeah. Like 100% sure.

Tom Ray: Yeah. And that's because people will go, here's your influence. And then you'll go, oh, let's see if I can pull that off. And it's a challenge. I could see that. Yeah, that would. Yeah, I would actually really enjoy that, to tell you the truth. That would be kind of fun.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: in the game dev community here in Canarias, I'm pretty much like, m. The guy. The guy for music.

Tom Ray: So that's not. That's not a bad thing. That's pretty cool.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah.

Tom Ray: All right. And is there any. As we wrap up here, I have one more question, which is basically, are there other things coming up that you would like to tell people about any games you're working on that people should, you know, keep an eye out for anything you want to?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Right now? Not really because, well, I'm dependent of. Of game jams, but I'm sure that in. I think in January will be the global game jam and, academic. That is one of the game dev community here in Gran Canaria. No, in Gran Canaria. No, in Canarias.

Tom Ray: Okay.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: So I have to make sure, we'll be hosting, a place to the global gen, and, I will be there if everything goes well. So.

Tom Ray: Okay. How big of a thing is that? How. How many people show up for that?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: here in Gran Canaria is not much so big, but in other places, like in Spain, in Malaga is like the biggest thing.

Tom Ray: Okay, so it's an event that's hosted in many places.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah, yeah, it's a. It's an international thing, so.

Tom Ray: Oh, wow. Okay, cool. And if people wanted to learn more about you or listen to your music, where could they go do that?

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: you can search me on. On. On, on the Feather verse, in Mastodon, like Artisan then I have Artisint as, nickname in Twitch. You can like. I'm sure that in 100% of the time, if anyone search like Artisinth.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: I will be one of the most, searched ones.

Tom Ray: I can agree. That's how I found you is I typed in Artisan. That actually showed up.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah. And that's why I made the change from A dot R, dot.

Tom Ray: It's even long to say. It's like we don't even want to finish doing the A dot R dot.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Yeah.

Tom Ray: We get that far. And then we're like. You get what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, I want to thank you so much for talking with me today. This has been great.

Jonatan Galindo Alvarez: Thank you to letting me in this interview. and, for the you want to use it summit.
