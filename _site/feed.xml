<h2 id="our-story-begins">Our Story Begins</h2>

<p>What started as late-night jam sessions in a basement studio has evolved into something we never could have imagined. Our sound - a unique blend of atmospheric textures, driving rhythms, and experimental production techniques - has been years in the making.</p>

<p>We describe our music as “experimental lofi rock,” but that barely scratches the surface. We blend:</p>

  <li>Atmospheric guitar textures that create immersive soundscapes</li>
  <li>Lofi production techniques that add warmth and character</li>
  <li>Experimental song structures that defy traditional pop conventions</li>
  <li>Electronic and organic instrumentation that creates unique sonic landscapes</li>
