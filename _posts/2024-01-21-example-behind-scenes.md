# Making of Friction Tango - Behind the Scenes

Ever wondered how we create our unique visual aesthetic? In this behind-the-scenes video, we take you through the entire process of making the "Friction Tango" music video.

## The Concept

We wanted to create a video that felt like discovering an old recording in a dusty attic. This meant combining vintage film techniques with modern digital processes to achieve the perfect balance of nostalgia and innovation.

## Production Process

### Pre-Production
- Storyboarding with vintage aesthetics in mind
- Location scouting for period-appropriate settings
- Equipment preparation (both vintage and modern)

### Filming
- Using vintage cameras alongside modern equipment
- Experimenting with different film stocks and digital effects
- Capturing the essence of old 78 rpm recordings

### Post-Production
- Combining analog and digital editing techniques
- Creating the VHS aesthetic through custom filters
- Color grading to match the song's mood

## Equipment Used

- **Vintage Cameras:** Various 8mm and 16mm cameras
- **Modern Equipment:** Digital cameras for backup footage
- **Editing Software:** Combination of analog and digital tools
- **Special Effects:** Custom VHS processing filters

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Maintaining Authenticity
We wanted the video to feel genuinely vintage while still being visually appealing to modern audiences.

**Solution:** We used a combination of actual vintage equipment and carefully crafted digital effects to achieve the perfect balance.

### Challenge: Technical Limitations
Working with vintage equipment presented various technical challenges.
