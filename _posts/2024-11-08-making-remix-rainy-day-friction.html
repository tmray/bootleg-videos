He begins by listening to the original stems, identifying key elements, and building upon them. His goal is to create a remix that not only pays homage to the original but also reflects his own musical style.</p><p>Nicholas explains how he selects and manipulates audio, uses MIDI synths, and layers the vocals. We talk about how he chose to focus on the chorus of "Rainy Day Friction," making it the centerpiece of his remix. Nicholas's remixing process also involves experimenting with various instruments and effects, creating a sound that is both contemporary and nostalgic, with influences from new wave and 60s orchestral music.</p><p>We also talk about the creative decision to add whispering vocals for a ghostly effect and balancing multiple instrument layers in the mix.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Links</h2><p>Nicholas Burgess Website&nbsp;<a href="https://nicholasburgess.com" target="_blank">https://nicholasburgess.com</a></p><div class="tomsbox"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Listen to the album!</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 1</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a class="fancy-button button flat-button" href="https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/07/lorenzos-remixes-volume-1.html">Listen to the album</a></p></div>
